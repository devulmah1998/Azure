#If we want to establish the communicationbetween the two services internally in azure we have concept
# called as Managed identities.
# 1) System assigned identities 2) user assigned identities.
# system assigned identities is one to one mapping between the resource and identity, like if you enable on enable on server level identity is mapped to the that particular server if you delete that server the identity also will deleted.
# user assigned identity is stand alone identity it we can create alone and use it's not depended on one resource, we can assign this to multiple resources.

# we store the secret key and  aws access key in key vaults service.
# we can connect the aws services from the azure server by accessing the key-vaults informations or credentials.
# server==>> key-vaults==>>connects to internet publicly. and get the information from the aws.
# with out connecting to internet we can go with private endpointsubnet it will create one interface it will used to connect the services through the public ip's.

# If a VM with system-assigned identity needs to read secrets from a Key Vault:

# Assign Key Vault Secrets User role to the VMâ€™s identity on that Key Vault using IAM.

# disable the public acccess in the azure key-vault networking dropdown.

# privateendpointsubnet interface directly connected to key-vaults.
# jumpserver traffic routed to privateendpoint interface through name resolution(Private dns zone will be created) than reached to key-valults directly.
